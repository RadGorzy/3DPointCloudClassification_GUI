TRAINING AND VALIDATION DATA is composed of projections extracted form semantically labeled point clouds downloaded from: http://www.semantic-kitti.org/dataset.html

Checkpoint after 353000 and 354000 iterations and ConsoleOutput in chekpoints folder.
Data composition:
Instances for classes 50 (building), 71 (tree trunk) and 80 (pole) were extracted by me (3DPointCloudClassificaion_GUI -prepare tab).
Classes 30 (person) and 10 (car) were already annoteted at the instance level. 

Classes 30 and 10 I cut from all sequances folders and merged them in here. Name convention:
ex. 02_000075_247 -> 02(sequence number)_000075(scene number within sequence)_247(instance number) 

For extracted classes:
Every object has a diffrent instance number, even if its the same object captured in diffrent image during capturing vehicle ride.

For classes descriptions look for /home/radek/DeepLearning/SemanticKITTI/ExtractObjects/CLASSES_INFO_semantic-kitti.yaml

number of objects:
car  		10 -> 74268+133980=208 248
person		30 -> 1253+6211=   7 464
building	50 -> 		   347 533
trunk		71 -> 		   105 636
pole		80 -> 		   67 458


DATASET BALANCING AND VALIDATION SPLIT
For classes "30" and "50" clouds with less than 25 points were removed (i forgot to skip them while i was extracting them). For rest of the classes it was alredy done while extracting single instances.

For class "50" first 139285 objects were removed (undersampling),after that 15 % was moved to validation
For class "30" additional 422 objects were added from (datasts_3D/person/PCD + datasts_3D/person/PCD_test)

In all cases validation = 15 % of training data

Only class "30" is balanced by copy (from 3518 to 4*3518 = 14072)

Each object in class with biggest numbers of objects ("50") has 5 projections so total number of images for this class (and all the other after balancing with variable number of pojections) is 177009*8=1416072

Projection parameters:
-Range image
-For class with buggest number of objects -> 8 projections per object -> for the rest variable number of projections (so the total for each class is 1 416 072)

Final nuber of images in each class may differ by couple images, because at the end i reomved some corrupted ones.
